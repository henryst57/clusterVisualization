Steps:
1) Generate Disease CUIs
	MySQL command to generate list of Diseases:
	select CUI from MRSTY where TUI='T047' INTO OUTFILE 'dysn.txt';

2) Generate a list all metabolites and diseases
	makeMetaboliteDiseasePairs.pl

3) Reduce the co-occurrence matrix so it is only metabolites and diseases
	reduceCooccurrenceMatrix.pl 

4) Generate LTC between cardiac arrest and all diseases
	umls-association-runDataSet.pl pairs/cardiacArrestDisease.pairs scores/metaboliteDiseases_ltc.scores --noorder --lta --measure freq --matrix metaboluteDisease_1975_2015_window8_threshold1 

5) format that output to something more understanding
	perl scoresToNiceOutput.pl
